# AvalancheJS

## Supported Platforms

This library is intended for use in Node.js (`^16.13 || ^18`) and in browsers.

> For Node.js 16, a polyfill for `fetch` is required.

## Run the examples

There are examples in the examples folder. These can be run with `npx @digitak/esrun`

1. cd into the examples folder
2. run `npx @digitak/esrun` with the path to the file as the arguement

I am reading that you can use `ts-node` as well with the --esm flag but I am yet to see this work
